# Nuxt Static

> Generate a static site using Nuxt.js

This project leverages the built-in [nuxt generate](https://nuxtjs.org/guide#static-generated-pre-rendering-) command but takes it one step further by saving out the API response data needed for pages in `.json` files so that your site can quickly load those local `.json` files instead.
